# 🧠 SQL Data Analysis Project: Olympic Athletes

## 🎯 Objective

Perform data analysis on Olympic athletes' data using SQL to derive meaningful insights and summaries. This task demonstrates the use of SQL for data exploration and reporting.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- SQLite (executed within Python using Google Colab)
- pandas (for CSV handling)
- sqlite3 (to create and interact with an in-memory SQL database)

## 📂 Dataset

- **File:** `athlete_events.csv`
- The dataset contains detailed records of athletes’ participation in Olympic events from 1896 to 2016.

## 📌 Table Information

- Table Name: `athletes`
- Created by importing the dataset into a SQLite database using pandas.

## 📊 Project Description

A variety of SQL queries were written to explore the dataset and derive insights related to athlete performance, country achievements, event-specific medals, and historical patterns.

All queries were executed in a Google Colab environment, with results verified and saved as part of the task deliverables.

## ✅ Deliverables

- `queries.sql`: Contains all SQL queries used for analysis.
- `README.md`: Project documentation describing tools, setup, and methodology.

## 📎 Notes

- This project is part of a data analysis task focusing on SQL-based data extraction and insight generation.
- It is submitted as part of coursework and intended for educational purposes.
